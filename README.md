**Arrow Detection using Template Matching and Contours**

**Description:**
This project implements an arrow detection system utilizing template matching and contour analysis techniques. It captures frames from a camera and processes them to identify and analyze arrow shapes in real-time video feeds. The system is capable of detecting both short-range and long-range arrows, providing directional information.

**Instructions:**
1. Ensure OpenCV and NumPy libraries are installed.
2. Connect the camera to the system.
3. Run the script to initiate the arrow detection system.
4. Press 'q' to exit the application.
5. Make sure that you update the location of the images in the code

**Files:**
- `arrow_detection.py`: Python script for arrow detection.
- `right.jpg`: Template image of a right arrow.
- `left.jpg`: Template image of a left arrow.

**Dependencies:**
- OpenCV
- NumPy

**Usage:**
```bash
python arrow_detection.py
```

**Note:**
- Adjust the camera settings and positioning for optimal performance.
- Ensure proper lighting conditions for accurate detection.
- Customize the threshold parameter for template matching as per requirements.
